# WiDS Datathon 2025 

- Problem statement: In this year’s WiDS Datathon, participants will be tasked with building a model to predict both an individual’s sex and their ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging data of children and adolescents and their socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information.

- Challenge Question and Task:
“What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?”
The task is to create a multi-outcome model to predict two separate target variables: 1) ADHD (1=yes or 0=no) and 2) female (1=yes or 0=no).

  - Data cleaning and preprocessing for model development and analysis
  - Understanding correlations
  - Regression model selection (statistical, machine learning)
  - Regression model fitting/testing (cross validation, avoiding over/underfitting, stratification of data during training)
  - Explaining factors that drive the performance of the model
  - Multi-outcome prediction
